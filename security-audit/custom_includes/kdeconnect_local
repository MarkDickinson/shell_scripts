# Common rules for desktops running KDECONNECT to provide android phone interface
# >>> Included File: ../custom_includes/kdeconnect_custom
#
# I have created a local /etc/firewalld/services/kdeconnect that
# only opens ports 1714-1715
# The default range of 1714-1764 in /usr/lib/firewalld/services/kdeconnect.xml is not opened
#
# It always uses 1716
UDP_PORTV6_ALLOWED=:1716:kdeconnect
TCP_PORTV6_ALLOWED=:1716:kdeconnect
#
# And it only opens the ports when active
