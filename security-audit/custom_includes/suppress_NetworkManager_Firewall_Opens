# This include file suppresses firewall alerts cause by NetworkManager
# opening ports 67, 68 and 69 in the firewall.
# I have not been able to find out why.
# On some servers where I use DNS a couple of those are OK, but
# thay are randomly (as far as I can tell) on servers as servers with
# identical packages, services and even moving KVMs between servers
# to ensure servers are running exactly the same software... have
# different ports opened in the firewall in this range.
#
# But one day I will find out why.
