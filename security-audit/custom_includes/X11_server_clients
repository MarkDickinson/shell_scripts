# Custom file rules for servers that provide X11 connectivity via SSH
# >>> Included File: ../custom_includes/X11_server_clients
#
# These ports may be in use if 'gdm' has been installed on the server
# and users connect ti the server with X11 forwarding enabled allowing them
# to run X11 programs on the remote server. The ports are only in use
# during client sessions.
#
# Network ports that may be used are 6010 upward, depending on the number of clients.
# This file assumes no more than two clients will be connected at one time so only
# includes the first two ports 6010 and 6011; you may wish to add more.
