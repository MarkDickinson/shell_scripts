# roots authorized_keys file and delete the last expected alert entry
# to make it four alerts expected.

# We expect the below alerts from a default Ubuntu 20.04 install
EXACT_ALERT_REASON=This server appears to be not running a firewall
EXACT_ALERT_REASON=SELinux is not installed on this server
EXACT_ALERT_REASON=Default minimum password length < 6, it is 0 in login.defs and 0 in pwquality.con
EXACT_ALERT_REASON=Unsafe SNAP packages are installed
EXACT_ALERT_REASON=root has an authorized_keys file
#
# The below text is inserted as is (without the parameter keyword prefix) into the expected
# alerts documentation file if any EXACT_ALERT_REASON= parameters were used. This is just to
# allow additional documentation as to why an alert is expected rather than resolved.
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=Neither iptables or netfilter rules are created on a default Ubuntt 20.04 install.
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=On Ubuntu 20.04 /etc/login.defs says pasword minumum length set there is ignored
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=and it must be set in pwquality.conf[.d] files; the default is commented and we
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=do not trust defaults so assume 0.
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=On a default Ubuntu 20.04 server install an empty authorized_keys file for the
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=root user is created; you should delete it as root should not use ssh keys.
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=Ubuntu uses SNAP packages, there are inherently unsafe as they install a lot
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=of setuid to root files in the snap directories that any user is able to run
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=(ie: if you lock down access to '/bin/su' there will be lots of other copies
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=of 'su' on the system any user can run quite happily). Worse users can install
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=user only snap files with the same issues. If snap files are installed there
EXACT_ALERT_REASON_NOTES=will always be alerts raised.
