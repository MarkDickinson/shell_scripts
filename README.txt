Created to store some shell scripts I do not wish to lose track of.
May be useful to others. May not be.

The main directory is general scripts.
   - makepdf.sh  
        pipe a text file into it and get output as a pdf file
   - nagios_submit_passive_update.sh
        submit nagios passive updates

   - common_functions.bash
        a work in progress, effectively a placeholder


Any subdirectories will be task specific scripts.
   - security-audit : scripts for security auditing RHEl based linux servers
